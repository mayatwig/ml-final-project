## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project was completed as part of the Introduction to Machine Learning course.  
The goal was to apply supervised learning techniques to a real-world tabular dataset in order to predict target values, compare model performance, and draw actionable insights.

## ðŸ§ª Methods Used  
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature selection & engineering  
- Model training & tuning:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest  
  - XGBoost  
- Model evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC AUC  

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Results  
- Best model: `Random Forest` with AUC = **0.89**  
- Feature importance highlighted strong correlation with `[feature name]`  
- Model generalized well with minimal overfitting
